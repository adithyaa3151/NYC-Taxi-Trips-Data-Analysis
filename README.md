# NYC Taxi Trips Data Analysis  

## Project Overview  
New York City (NYC), one of the world’s largest and most vibrant metropolises, relies heavily on its taxis to supplement its bustling public transportation system. Taxis fill critical gaps in areas where subways and buses may not be accessible, providing fast and flexible services to millions of passengers daily.  

This project delves into the complexities of NYC’s taxi operations, aiming to uncover customer demand patterns, regional preferences, and factors influencing tipping behavior. Using a dataset of over 2 million records, we employ advanced analytics to offer actionable insights for enhancing operational efficiency, increasing profitability, and improving customer satisfaction.  

## Objectives  
The project focuses on addressing the following challenges:  
- **Variability in Demand**: Analyze how time, region, and customer preferences impact taxi demand.  
- **Income Patterns**: Investigate profitability tied to specific regions and travel routes.  
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Explore factors, such as tipping, that reflect customer appreciation and loyalty.  
- **Operational Optimization**: Provide strategies for better fleet distribution to reduce costs and improve efficiency.  

## Key Goals  
1. **Optimize Fleet Distribution**  
   - Align taxi availability with customer demand patterns to reduce operational costs and improve efficiency.  
2. **Enhance Customer Satisfaction**  
   - Understand customer preferences to tailor services, boosting loyalty and retention.  
3. **Maximize Revenue**  
   - Explore pricing strategies, promotions, and additional services for better earnings through regional and route analysis.  
4. **Encourage Customer Appreciation**  
   - Identify tipping behavior trends and develop strategies to foster customer appreciation.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **PySpark**: Scalable data processing and analytics.  
- **Azure Databricks**: Cloud platform for collaborative data analysis.  
- **Python**: Programming language for building workflows and analytics.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Documentation of insights and analysis.  

## Workflow Highlights  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed incomplete and anomalous records, ensuring high data quality.  
2. **Data Enrichment**  
   - Integrated NYC Zones dataset to analyze trip origins and destinations.  
   - Calculated per-trip profitability to rank zones and routes.  
3. **Analytics**  
   - Summarized trip data by zone to identify high-demand and high-profit areas.  
   - Benchmarked performance workflows to ensure scalability and efficiency.  

## Insights  
- **Regional Analysis**: Identified the most profitable zones and routes, providing recommendations for fleet distribution.  
- **Customer Preferences**: Uncovered patterns in tipping behavior, influencing customer satisfaction strategies.  
- **Revenue Optimization**: Highlighted opportunities for boosting earnings through strategic planning.
